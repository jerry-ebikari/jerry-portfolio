        Hello! I'm Jerry Ebikari. I make well designed and responsive web apps, and the backends that power them.
        I am an experienced frontend developer with a strong foundation in backend development. I thrive in
        fast-paced environments and have hands-on experience with a wide range of web development
        technologies, from frontend and backend languages to cloud platforms like AWS for application
        deployment. I also handle task automation using tools like Ansible and OS-specific scripts. My goal is
        always to deliver impactful solutions that make a difference.
