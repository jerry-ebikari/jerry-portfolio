        Hello! My name is Ebikari Jerry and I make well designed and responsive websites.
        I am a first class graduate of Electrical/Electronic Engineering with a knack for solving complex problems and an abnormally high level of attention to detail. I have a great eye for design and often utilize data structures and algorithms for building beautiful, efficient and feature-rich websites and applications. I am open to roles in backend and frontend web development. <a routerLink="/projects">See projects</a>
